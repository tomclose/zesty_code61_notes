Welcome to the course preparation for the Introduction to Web Programming course!

The course will cover a basic introduction to web progamming, starting from scratch. You will develop your understanding of how the internet works, learn to code a basic site using HTML and CSS, and learn how to manage your code and get your site online using a tool called git. This course is a pre-requisite for all other courses offered by The Oxford Codelab.

There are many excellent resources on the web for learning a lot of this material. We don't want to reinvent the wheel and will unashamedly point you towards better sources of information when they exist. Rather than teach you everything from scratch, we aim to guide and support your learning. 

### Installing software

One of the biggest challenges in a course like this is dealing with the different operating systems and hardware that you'll be working on. We have decided against getting everyone to run a linux virtual machine (or similar) for the course, as it's really important that web development is something that you can do in your natural computing environment.

That does mean that there's a bit of setting up that you will need to do to be ready for the first session next week. Please be patient with this - installing software is fiddly and not always predictable. Most of the work we get you to do won't be like this!

The tabs on the left hand side will take you through installing the software you'll need for the course. Instructions are given in blue boxes.
