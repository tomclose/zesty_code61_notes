Git is a program that helps with the management of code. It means that you completely avoid the situation where you end up with files called `team_contacts_v1`, `team_contacts_v2` etc. It also allows you to share your code with others and collaborate on code in an efficient way.

GitHub is a site that makes sharing code part of git really easy. It is the go-to choice both for startups and open-source software projects. (There are several other sites that are similar to GitHub e.g. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org), but GitHub is the most widely used.)

GitHub also allows you to put a static website online for free, using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). We will be making use of this feature during the course.
