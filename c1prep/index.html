		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		
<p>Welcome to the course preparation for the Introduction to Web Programming course!</p>

<p>The course will cover a basic introduction to web progamming, starting from scratch. You will develop your understanding of how the internet works, learn to code a basic site using HTML and CSS, and learn how to manage your code and get your site online using a tool called git. This course is a pre-requisite for all other courses offered by The Oxford Codelab.</p>

<p>There are many excellent resources on the web for learning a lot of this material. We don’t want to reinvent the wheel and will unashamedly point you towards better sources of information when they exist. Rather than teach you everything from scratch, we aim to guide and support your learning.</p>

<h3 id="installing_software">Installing software</h3>

<p>One of the biggest challenges in a course like this is dealing with the different operating systems and hardware that you’ll be working on. We have decided against getting everyone to run a linux virtual machine (or similar) for the course, as it’s really important that web development is something that you can do in your natural computing environment.</p>

<p>That does mean that there’s a bit of setting up that you will need to do to be ready for the first session next week. Please be patient with this - installing software is fiddly and not always predictable. Most of the work we get you to do won’t be like this!</p>

<p>The tabs on the left hand side will take you through installing the software you’ll need for the course. Instructions are given in blue boxes.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>Task:</strong> 

<p>The blue boxes tell you what you need to do!</p>

</div>
<p>If you have any problems, please contact the tech team!</p>

	<div class="tab-pane " id="1_google_chrome">
	

		<h2>Google Chrome</h2>
		<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>Task:</strong> 

<p>Download and install <a href='https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/'>Google Chrome</a>.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="why_do_i_need_chrome">Why do I need Chrome?</h3>

<p>Chrome is a free web browser provided by Google. There are several other web browsers that you might have used, including Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox and Opera. We will be using Chrome as it comes with a good set of developer tools that we will be using over the course.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Firefox</a> also comes with an excellent set of developer tools (via its <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug extension</a>). There doesn’t seem to be much between Chrome and Firefox+firebug as far as the tools we’ll be using go. The decision to recommend Chrome was fairly arbitrary, but means that everyone will be using the same software.</p>

	</div>

	
	<div class="tab-pane " id="2_sublime_text">
	

		<h2>Sublime Text</h2>
		<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>Task:</strong> 

<p>Download and install the appropriate version of Sublime Text for your computer from <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/'>http://www.sublimetext.com/</a>.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="why_do_i_need_sublime_text">Why do I need Sublime Text?</h3>

<p>Sublime Text is a <em>text editor</em> - a program that can be used for writing code.</p>

<p>When you write code it is important that the editor stores just the text you wrote, so that it can be properly interpreted when you run it. Word processors, like MS Word, add a lot of extra information to the text you write - layout, font styles, etc. - so can’t be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>You probably already have a text editor, such as notepad or textedit, on your laptop that could be used for writing code. Sublime Text is better because it also does <em>syntax highlighting</em> - it will colour your code, making it easier to see what’s going on.</p>

<h3 id="do_i_need_to_pay">Do I need to pay?</h3>

<p>Sublime Text costs $70 but <strong>you can use it for free</strong> as it has an indefinite evaluation period. The duration of the course seems like a pretty reasonable period of time to evaluate the software. If you go on to use it after that you should consider getting a license - it’s a good product and the guys who make it have to eat!</p>

<h3 id="why_sublime_text">Why Sublime Text?</h3>

<p>There are many text editors available including many excellent free and/or open source ones. Sublime Text is a popular code editor in the web development world at the moment and benefits from an active community of developers contributing add-ons and improvements. Although it isn’t free or open source, we have chosen it as our recommended editor as it: (a) gives a good user experience on mac, linux and windows; (b) is easy to get started with; and (c) can be easily customised when you get more advanced.</p>

<p>If have a different text editor that you are already used to using, feel free to use that instead!</p>

	<div class="tab-pane " id="3_github_account">
	

		<h2>GitHub account</h2>
		
<p>Git is a program that helps with the management of code. It means that you completely avoid the situation where you end up with files called <code>team_contacts_v1</code>, <code>team_contacts_v2</code> etc. It also allows you to share your code with others and collaborate on code in an efficient way.</p>

<p>GitHub is a site that makes sharing code part of git really easy. It is the go-to choice both for startups and open-source software projects. (There are several other sites that are similar to GitHub e.g. <a href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>, but GitHub is the most widely used.)</p>

<p>GitHub also allows you to put a static website online for free, using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. We will be making use of this feature during the course.</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>Task:</strong> 

<p>Sign up for a GitHub account at <a href='https://github.com/'>https://github.com/</a>. Make sure you <strong>know your password</strong> to avoid awkward moments in class!</p>

		<h2>Preparation exercises</h2>
		
<p>Well done for getting to this point! You should now have all the software you need to start the course.</p>

<p>In the first session we will be looking at HTML and the overall structure of the internet. We won’t be spending much time on these, so it will help if you’ve at least seen then before. To help everyone has a basic amount of knowledge to start, please do the following:</p>
<div class='exercise alert alert-info'><strong>Task:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Watch <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA'>these</a> <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7ripK5uGM'>two</a> videos about the DNS system: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA'>video1</a> (excuse the political overtones), <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN7ripK5uGM'>video2</a></li>

<li>Sign up to <a href='https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects'>General Assembly Dash</a> and complete the whole of Project 1. (Will probably take about 30mins).</li>

<li>(Optional) Sign up to <a href='http://www.codecademy.com/'>Codecademy</a>. On the <a href='http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web'>Codecademy web track</a>:
<ol>
<li>Do the project from &quot;1 Introduction to HTML&quot;.</li>

<li>Do the project from &quot;2 HTML Structure: Using Lists&quot;.</li>

<li>Do the project from &quot;3 HTML Structure: Tables, Divs, and Spans&quot;.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Look forward to seeing you on Tuesday!</p>
